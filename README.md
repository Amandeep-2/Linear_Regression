# Linear_Regression
I am learning and writing about Linear Regression

I am writing about the Process which I used to create this Repository as well as I will write about how I pushed code from Local to git.

1. I created a new Repository at github.com after logging into my account. I named it Linear Regression

2. I just wrote some description and selected one Public License.

3. I cloned/copied this project from git to my Local using a command 
    git clone https://github.com/Amandeep-2/Linear_Regression.git"

4. I created a virtual environment in my Local using python command
    python -m venv Python

5. Then I thought that I should push it to my Git.ðŸ¤”

6. I just googled all the commands and it worked for me. You might require to sign in git, I have tried earlier to push so maybe I have already signed in git CLI( command line interface )

7. These are all Git commands I used to push the code

    git add .
    git status   """ It is not required but I just checked """
    git commit -m "First commit"  # First commit is just a comment You can put anything
    git push 

8. And It's done looks very easy but I read all commands again here.

9. I created a Python file using 
    copy con linear_regression.py
    """ Here you can write anything and 
    It will be stored in the file
    if you want to save the file then press "ctrl+z"
    you will see ^Z and just press "enter"

    That's how I creted a python file without notepad or anything else.

10. Now I typed the command 
    Python\Scripts\activate
   in cmd and started the virtual environment.

11. I installed pandas using 
    pip install pandas

12. I am using VS code to edit the file but you can use any editor. This step is not needed but just bear with it.

13. Let me put some Theoritical things here

    Difference B/w Linear and Logistic Regression

    > Linear Regression is represented by lineear chart while Logistic regression is represented by sigmoid chart.
    > Linear Regression is done on Continuous Data, while Logistic Regression is done on categorical data.
    > Linear Regression generated value as an output while Logistic Regression generated Probability.
    > Results of Linear Regression is measured using Loss, R squared, adjuested R squared. Logistic Regression is measured using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 curve, ROC curve, Confusion Matrix.
    > Age is continuous of told in numbers like 20,22,30,18 and Categorical if told using words like teen, young, adult, old.
